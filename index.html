    Red = Ded by Malav Mehta, Justin Lu and Thomas Cwintal submitted on Friday, June 14, 2019
    to Mr. Benjamin Hudson as part of the ICS2O course.
    This game was created for clients from Thomas Darcy McGee, and was created to explore the usage
    and knowledge of JS Document Object Models, Loops, Logic (selection, string), CSS styling techniques,
    including Classes, Ids, and root variables, and finally HTML knowledge used to script the website.
    This is the single page HTML document used to create elements shown to the user.
